## What can I found here?

This repo show how to submit a simple transaction on a fake Ethereum blockchain (ganache).

It also provide an example of the compilation and deployement of a contract on that blockchain.

### What's next?

I guess the next step is to provide a script that use a testnet blockchain like Ropsten and even the actual Ethereum blockchain (mainnet).
